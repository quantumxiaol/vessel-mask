## Inference

To set up the environment and install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

#### Build conda environment
1. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment  
```bash
conda create -n topcow_claim python==3.11   
conda activate topcow_claim  
 ```

2. Install the requirements
```bash
pip install ultralytics
cd topcow-2024-nnunet
pip install -e .
```

#### Download model weights
Download model weights from Zenodo:  
- https://zenodo.org/records/14191592

Place models inside **models** folder:
- models/yolo-cow-detection.pt
- models/topcow-claim-models

### Running inference

Run the segment_circle_of_willis.py specifying following variables in the beginning of the segment_circle_of_willis.py script:  
(1) YOLO_FILE_PATH: the path to the yolo model    
(2) SEGMODEL_DIR_PATH: the folder containing the trained nnUnet segmentation models  
(3) IMG_FOLDER: the folder containing the input CTA or TOF-MRA images  
(4) SEGMENTATION_FOLDER: the folder where the segmentation results should be stored   

## Training details 
An additional 500 patients (250 CTA, 250 MRA) were included in the training dataset. All used in-house and public datasets are detailed in the Table below.  
Inclusion criteria on additional data were:   
(1) No intracranial aneurisms in CoW ROI **AND**   
(2) Baseline segmentation model made topological mistakes **OR**  
(3) Rare variants in 3D vessel geometry such as 3rd A2 segment, hypoplastic A1 segment, patients with vessel occlusions 

First, TopCoW data was used to create the baseline, pre-labeling model. We used this model to create labels for a large (>3000) set of scans, that were used to 1) pre-select additional patients following above inclusion criteria and 2) to manually refine segmentation labels for ground truth. 
Second, once labels were refined we used 125-125 MRA and CTA scans additionally to TopCoW data for internal model experiments, review and hyper parameter tuning.
The full dataset used to train our final model for submission contained 750 scans (TopCoW+500 additional). 

Manual segmentation was based on initial pre-labeling from the baseline model and refined by 1 junior rater (1-2 years experience with vessel segmentation) and 1 senior rater (5+ years experience with vessel segmentation). Special attention was paid to correcting Acom, Pcom, 3rd A2 and unusual geometries. Manual segmentations were done in ITK-Snap.

2. **Model training:**
   - **ResEncM** model of the nnUNet framework
   - trained using 5-fold cross-validation 
   - Skeleton-Recall loss utilized  (see References)
